You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see Amazon EC2 Instance Types for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the ACTIVE status, it can begin hosting game sessions. To create a new fleet, provide a fleet name, an EC2 instance type, and a build ID of the game build to deploy. You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings: (1) a runtime configuration describing what server processes to run on each instance in the fleet (required to create fleet), (2) access permissions for inbound traffic, (3) fleet-wide game session protection, and (4) the location of default log files for GameLift to upload and store. If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:   Creates a fleet record and sets the status to NEW (followed by other statuses as the fleet is activated).   Sets the fleet's capacity to 1 "desired", which causes GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.   Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the GameLift console.   Sets the fleet's status to ACTIVE once one server process in the fleet is ready to host a game session.

UpdateFleetCapacity -- Increase or decrease the number of instances you want the fleet to maintain.    UpdateFleetPortSettings -- Change the IP address and port ranges that allow access to incoming traffic.
